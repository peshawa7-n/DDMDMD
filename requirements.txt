# Core library for the Telegram Bot API
python-telegram-bot

# For downloading videos (yt-dlp command-line tool needs to be installed on the system)
# This is NOT a Python library, but its presence is crucial for the bot's functionality.
# You'll need to ensure Railway's environment has yt-dlp installed,
# or handle its installation within your Railway build process (e.g., via a Dockerfile).

# For handling HTTP requests (used by python-telegram-bot internally)
httpx

# For parsing environment variables (useful for local development, optional for Railway)
python-dotenv

# A production-ready WSGI HTTP server (MANDATORY for webhooks on Railway)
gunicorn
